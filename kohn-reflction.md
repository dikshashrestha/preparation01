# Kohn's Grade Reflection

There have been many instances where I believed my grades were low compared to what I was expecting. To be particular in pointing out my experience, it would be during my second semester in my undergraduate, I had my economics final exam and final project submission where I performed well and answered all the questions that was required. The grade that I received was B+, however, I was expecting an A or at least A-. Upon liaising with my professor for the reason for my grade below my expectation, I was advised that my projects didn't have an explanation of one of the topics from the course. 


The education system that we have grown up reflects how grades plays an important role on our future i.e. getting into a reputed university or getting a good job. This leads the students to feel pressurize of getting a good grade. Talking about my experience during my school, I too felt pressurized of getting a good grade. I was an average student who felt scared of taking a risk and was just focused on getting a good grade which didn't let me explore my horizons and push my limits. Gradually, during my high school and my undergraduate, I enjoyed learning new things and didn't much think about the grades that I will get. This thinking helped me explore my creativity and last also helped me in securing a good grade. So, for me grades are just a number, it doesn't define who we are and what we are capable of. _What matters is the skills that you have and how you present it in the corporate world not the grade that you receive in an exam._


Everyone will have a motivation to achieve what they want in their life, however, motivation alone wouldn't suffice. Motivation is the thing that comes and goes but what makes the motivation consistent is the self-discipline. Everyone should be disciplined enough to follow their goals. If the grades were removed, I would use following things for my motivation:
* An opportunity to explore my ideas like a free bird without risking for the grades.
* Being disciplined to achieve my end goal.
* Being able to learn and explore new things


The time where I took the easy way out would be during my school when I was in Grade 6, I was on leave for a whole week due to my health issues and I had an assignment due the next week. I was liaising with my friends for the notes of the class that I missed and instead of going through the notes and researching on my own, I seek help from my friends on doing my assignment. Thinking now of why I chose that route would basically be because:
1. I was scared as my assignment was already due.
2. The next reason would be I was procrastinating all over the week when my friends had already provided me with the notes to start on the assignment.
3. I was not confident on myself that I would have been able to the assignment on my own.
With time and how the education system now is growing, students too have realized that the grade doesn't define who we can be and what we are qualified for.
